**Tableau Dashboard for Weather Data**

_Version: Tableau Desktop 2023.2.1_

The interactive dashboard offers a comprehensive view of weather conditions, providing valuable insight.

**Dashboard Highlights:**

-	Current Weather: At the top of the dashboard, you'll find real-time data displaying the current day's temperature and hourly precipitation.
-	Averages: The top left and right sections feature average temperature and precipitation data, giving you a quick overview.

**What Makes Our Weather Forecast Unique:**

Diving deeper, the bottom part of the dashboard sets our weather forecast apart from the typical ones:

-	Historical Weather: On the left side, you can explore the historical weather forecast for the exact same day, but 20 years in the past. To enhance clarity, precipitation data for this period is color-coded, making it easier to understand the amounts in millimeters.
-	Future Predictions: On the right side, you'll find our model's predictions for the next 20 years, all for this very day. Similar to the historical data, the highest predicted temperature is displayed as a numerical value.

This dashboard offers a unique perspective on weather data, allowing you to compare current conditions, historical trends, and future forecasts seamlessly in one place. 
For usage instructions and more information, please refer to the Tableau Desktop 2023.2.1 documentation.
